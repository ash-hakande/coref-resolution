This is the ML project repository of the group Christopher working on Coreference Resolution.

Coreference resolution is the process of determining whether two expressions in natural language refer to the same entity in the world. It is an important subtask in natural language processing and information retrieval systems. We have used following five methods to extract co-references.

1. Hobbâ€™s Algorithm
2. Traditional Classifiers
3. Multilayer Perceptron [(view more)](https://github.com/cs60050/Christopher/tree/master/MLP)
4. Skip-thought Vectors
5. Long Short Term Memory
